                                        YUPC is Yale's first and only student organization dedicated specifically to the art of piano playing. When you become a member of YUPC, you can

                                        <li>be a part of &ldquo;studio classes,&rdquo; where pianists play for each other in an informal, relaxed setting, receive feedback from peers, and eat food;</li>
                                        <li>participate in masterclasses taught by concert pianists;</li>
                                        <li>perform in collaborative piano concerts; and</li>

                                        <h2 class=major>Application process</h2>
                                        YUPC strives to be an inclusive organization, and all undergraduate pianists at Yale are invited to apply. However, since we engage with challenging repertoire and have a limited amount of time to prepare for performances, we do want to make sure that each member has a substantial background in piano performance. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <!-- With that in mind, we will be holding auditions for potential new members on September 16 from 4 PM to 6 PM (location TBA). Each applicant is asked to bring 1-3 pieces that are approximately 10 minutes in total duration and demonstrate musical and technical ability. The program is up to you, though we recommend that at least one piece be part of the standard piano repertoire. Memorization is not required (but certainly won't hurt if you do it well!).  You can initiate your application by filling out the form below. <i>The form must be submitted by 11:59 P.M. on Tuesday, September 12.</i><br><br> -->
                                    
                                        <!--Please note that any applicant who has cleared the audition process for a credit-bearing performance course (e.g., lessons for credit or chamber music) is <em>exempt</em> from the audition requirement. (We do not require that you enroll in the course&mdash;just that you receive admission. You still must fill out the application form below.) <br><br> -->
                                     
					<i>Applications have closed for our Fall 2024 cycle. Application and audition information for our Spring 2025 cycle will be announced in January.</i><br><br>
					<!--Audition information and our application for 2022-2023 can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScs5EhcVnwl_iCuYwSg4iNiN2hQGfcQOHcR_YL10qrNER1o2A/viewform?usp=sf_link">HERE</A>!-->
                                     <!-- <i>Applications and auditions for 2020-2021 have already taken place, but we will accept video submissions at <a href="mailto:recruitment@yalepiano.org"> recruitment@yalepiano.org</a> throughout the semester. Please prepare about 10 minutes of music that demonstrate musical and technical ability.</i><br><br>

                                        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                                            <li>Perform in one public concert</li>
                                            <li>Perform in one studio class</li>
                                            <li>Attend a studio class in which one is not performing</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <p>It is also expected that members will treat each other respectfully and be receptive to musical ideas different from their own. This open-minded outlook is especially crucial for studio classes and collaborative performances. The success of YUPC depends on its welcoming, friendly, and lively culture.</p>
